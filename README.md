# Lending Club Case Study

> You are employed by a consumer finance company that specializes in providing various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it must evaluate whether to approve or deny the loan based on the applicant's profile. There are two types of risks associated with the company's decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, rejecting the loan application results in a loss of business for the company.

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, meaning they are at risk of defaulting, approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The dataset provided below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted on their loans or not. The objective is to identify patterns that can indicate the likelihood of a person defaulting. This information can be used to make informed decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or offering loans to risky applicants at higher interest rates, among other actions.

In this case study, you will utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the likelihood of loan default.

## General Information

Case Study elaborates a condition where a Business (Lending Club) has a dataset of loan applicants and their related payment history.
Refering to the dataset Business wants to identify the Loan Applicants who could be possible future prospects for the Business or the Loan Applicants who could cause loss to the Business. If we are able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced / denied / charged at higher rates/duration shortened thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.


## Conclusions

From the data analysis done so far, its found that there is around 1/6th of the total number of members (of data set considered) have been charged off and mostly they were on Rent or had Mortgage and were Not Verified.
A lot of non - compliance count was found related to loan applicantâ€™s verification process.
